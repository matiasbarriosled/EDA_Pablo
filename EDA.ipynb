It is a little overwhelming when you walk in. You'll see furniture piled up to the ceiling! It is used furniture, so don't go in there expecting to find miracle pieces. It's also not the cheapest, you are not going to find thrift store prices. The Uhuru project benefits the African People's Education and Defense Fund, so I don't mind spending a little more here than I would at a Goodwill. \\n\\nThe staff is great and they will deliver for a relatively low price. We live in Center City and I think it was about $25...cheaper and easier than having to rent a truck ourselves!\\n\\nWe picked a dresser that was WAY in the back, stacked under about 3 other large wooden pieces of furniture and they were more than happy to help us out. It needs a coat of paint to cover up some little marks, but it's in great condition. You'll definitely find good, sturdy pieces here that are worth the investment.\\n\\nThey also have a lot of knick-knack sort of things too if you're into that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n","So good!

The waitress told us that The Farm Burger is the most popular. I for one have never had a burger with an egg and the thought of it isn't very appealing. \\n\\nI ended up ordering the 'Pharmacy Burger', which is a less cheesier version of their 'Cheese Burger' that my husband ordered. They LOADED the mustard, but that really wasn't what I didn't like about it. It really wasn't that I disliked the burger, it just wasn't anywhere near one of the best burgers that I've had. The extra toppings at fifty cents each are pretty skimpy too. I was a fan of the wasabi aioli though. I also loved the tater tots though. I highly recommend ordering tater tots over the french fries. The beer cheese dipping sauce was an extra dollar and was borderline disgusting. Stick with wasabi aioli. \\n\\nI'm thinking that the toppings and sauces are possibly what the hype about this place is, otherwise, I just don't get it.

The label \\\"luxury\\\" is disgraceful. The only thing \\\"updated\\\" is the kitchen, floors, and a splash of new paint on the bathroom walls. The bathroom cabinets and counters are super old and outdated. When we moved in our vanity was outdated in the bedroom and literally looked like it was going to cave in. It took 6 months for them to finally replace it. There was entire sections in the kitchen and living room that weren't finished being painted, along with paint chipping in the master bedroom. Sure these issues aren't a cause for concern but do not let these apartment fool you by using words like \\\"luxury\\\" and \\\"newly\\\" or \\\"renovated\\\". It's a ploy and sadly it works. \\n\\nThese apartment have been through 4 managers in two years. Nobody passes on the message of issues that are going on, and unless you come into remind them for weeks.. it just simply won't get done. If you need someone to let you into YOUR apartment there's a $25 fee applied... I accidentally locked the apartment and had both the keys with me and my fianc\\u00e9 got locked out with our 4 month old. He went to the office with our tired, hot, screaming baby and they acted annoyed and stated there's a$25 fee for this.. only after letting them know he has a heart condition that the heat exasperates they didn't charge us. If you don't dispose of trash \\\"correctly\\\" there's a $50 fee applied. Just be hopeful that the current trash guy actually comes to get it like you pay for them too. \\n\\nThere isn't nearly enough parking for residents. I hated leaving after 7pm because there was no guarantee I'd have a place to park again when I got back. If you want to be ensured you have a parking spot to come home to.. their solution was to have you pay an additional $30 a month to reserve a spot if you desire. How sweet. What do you do if there's no place to park? Well they did the courtesy of working with auto zone next door to park your car there. If this does happen to you - beware of the smelly reclaimed water sprinkles getting you wet.. the only way to avoid them is to literally walk in the middle of Starkey road. IF you do have the luck of finding a spot, you risk walking far, in the rain, with your belongings/groceries. I hope you don't have children, it sucks. \\n\\nThe AC constantly freezes!!! Numerous residents have this issue. It took almost 6 months for them to finally replace our until which lead to 6 months of sky high electric bills. The result is that the air just runs and runs even though it's frozen, making it work twice as hard. \\n\\nMy daughters room had a wall that literally started to cave in because it was fixed with just wire and plaster after being fixed due to something that obviously happened before we moved in. My daughter had a small chair that was by that wall and when she sat in it one day it bumped the wall and an entire portion of the wall dented in. They came and \\\"fixed\\\" it with more plaster. \\n\\nThe ACs leak and cause mold/mildew in the walls. We are the second person we know that this has happened to! The water damage starts with wet carpet in the closet, and eventually leads to water damage behind the wall that gets ignored and untested. The day we had to be out of the apartment - we literally had to vacate due to my fianc\\u00e9 who has a serious heart condition finding MOLD. WHERE WE REPORTED IT. The issue was never dealt with thoroughly.\\n\\nWhen we vacated, it meant that we had to leave behind the remaining of our belongings and trash that was left behind. It wasn't worth the risks or health of our family to pack up and throw away the remaining stuff. We were never able to properly clean out the apartment due to the mold and this is something that we had ever intention of doing. This has since lead to an addition $600 to our move out costs. \\n\\nAfter speaking to the property manager, she states we should have reported it to be tested. On a Saturday night, after hours, on our move out date? I have even offered to send them my fianc\\u00e9s medical records from his Dr. to verify that those conditions are dangerous for him! \\n\\nWe know other tenants that broke their lease because the upstairs neighbors were letting their dog poop and pee all over the deck.. which then would fall through the cracks onto their belongings below. The office never did anything about the issue. While friends of our last ended up with bed bugs.. but once they moved out NEVER had the issue again? \\n\\nYou may ask, why'd you stay? Well we have a family and two young kids. We both work full time and I go to school. We didn't have $2400 to break the lease. Which you have to provide 60 days to do by the way. This place is literally a rip off, and I wish nobody the misfortune of being trapped like we were. This is a legitimate warning... and I hope you take it. DO NOT MOVE HERE PLEASE!!!\",\n          \"Absolutely one of the best pho experiences I've had so far. I had shrimp pho and the flavor of the broth was soooo good.
